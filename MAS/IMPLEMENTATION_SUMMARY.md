```

### 2. Scaffolding Selection
```
Learner Profile + ZPD + Map Analysis → Scaffolding Type + Intensity Selection
```

### 3. Interactive Dialogue
```
Prompt Generation → User Response → Response Analysis → Follow-up Generation → Conclusion
```

### 4. Adaptive Adjustment
```
Response Patterns → ZPD Update → Scaffolding Adaptation → Next Round Preparation
```

## Scaffolding Types Implementation

### Strategic Scaffolding
**When Used**: Planning and organizational challenges
**Approach**: 
- Guides task breakdown and planning
- Suggests organizational strategies
- Promotes systematic thinking
- Never provides direct organizational solutions

**Example Prompts**:
- "How did you decide which concepts to include first?"
- "What strategy did you use to arrange these concepts?"
- "How might you group related concepts more effectively?"

### Metacognitive Scaffolding
**When Used**: Self-awareness and reflection needs
**Approach**:
- Promotes self-assessment and monitoring
- Encourages goal-setting and strategy evaluation
- Develops learning awareness
- Supports confidence building

**Example Prompts**:
- "Which part of your map do you feel most confident about?"
- "How has your understanding changed since the last round?"
- "What would you like to understand better about this topic?"

### Procedural Scaffolding
**When Used**: Technical or process difficulties
**Approach**:
- Provides tool usage guidance
- Supports workflow development
- Offers process hints and techniques
- Assists with systematic approaches

**Example Prompts**:
- "Would you like guidance on showing different relationship types?"
- "How do you typically decide which concepts to add first?"
- "What process do you follow when creating concept maps?"

### Conceptual Scaffolding
**When Used**: Domain knowledge gaps or misconceptions
**Approach**:
- Highlights missing connections
- Addresses misconceptions indirectly
- Guides concept exploration
- Prompts deeper thinking about relationships

**Example Prompts**:
- "Are there important concepts missing that might connect to these?"
- "How do you think these concepts specifically relate?"
- "What underlying mechanisms might explain these connections?"

## Adaptive Features

### 1. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Assessment
- Continuous assessment of learner competence

- Progressive scaffolding fading as competence develops
- Personalized challenge level maintenance

### 2. Response-Based Adaptation

### After Implementation
- **Active Partnership**: System engages in educational dialogue
- **Adaptive Scaffolding**: Personalized support based on individual needs
- **Interactive Dialogue**: Two-way conversation with follow-up questions
