# Interactive Experimental Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Scaffolding System has been successfully transformed from a basic prototype into a fully interactive experimental research platform. This document summarizes the key improvements and capabilities implemented.

## Key Transformations

### 1. Interactive Learner Profile Creation ✅

**Before**: Sample profiles loaded from JSON files
**After**: User-driven profile creation through guided questions

- **Implementation**: `InteractiveExperimentalSession.create_learner_profile()`
- **Questions Include**:
  - Name, background, prior knowledge
  - Confidence level, interests, goals
  - Automatic ZPD level initialization at "medium"
- **Data Storage**: All profiles saved to session logs
- **No Sample Data**: Completely user-driven, no pre-loaded profiles

### 2. Randomized Non-Repeating Agent Selection ✅

**Before**: Fixed agent sequence
**After**: Randomized, unique agent order per participant

- **Implementation**: `InteractiveExperimentalSession.initialize_agent_sequence()`
- **Agents**: 4 scaffolding types (conceptual, strategic, metacognitive, procedural)
- **Randomization**: `random.shuffle()` ensures unique order per session
- **Tracking**: Used agents stored in session log to prevent repetition
- **Experimental Validity**: Each participant experiences different agent sequences

### 3. Interactive Round Handling ✅

**Before**: Simulated interactions
**After**: Real user interaction with OpenAI integration

- **Implementation**: `InteractiveExperimentalSession.conduct_scaffolding_round()`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time OpenAI API calls for scaffolding responses
  - User input/output managed by CLINE (no placeholder prompts)
  - Cumulative concept map building (no overwrites)
  - Comprehensive interaction logging
  - Error handling with demo fallbacks

### 4. Mode Selection ✅

**Before**: Fixed demo mode
**After**: User choice between experimental and demo modes

- **Implementation**: `InteractiveExperimentalSession.select_mode()`
- **Default**: Experimental mode if no input provided
- **Experimental Mode**: Full OpenAI integration, real user study
- **Demo Mode**: Showcases scaffolding prompts without API calls

### 5. Comprehensive Logging ✅

**Before**: Basic placeholder comment
**After**: Complete structured logging system

- **Implementation**: Session data tracking throughout entire interaction
- **Logged Data**:
  - Learner profiles with timestamps
  - Agent sequence and usage tracking
  - Round timings and durations
  - All user responses and agent outputs
  - Concept map evolution across rounds
  - OpenAI API usage statistics
- **Export Formats**: JSON (complete data) + CSV (analysis-ready)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

1. **InteractiveExperimentalSession**
   - Main orchestrator for experimental sessions
   - Manages user interaction flow
   - Handles data collection and export

2. **MultiAgentScaffoldingSystem** (Enhanced)
   - Supports both experimental and demo modes
   - Integrates OpenAI API for real scaffolding
   - Manages agent sequences and session state

### Key Methods

- `ask_user_question()`: CLINE-managed user input
- `create_learner_profile()`: Interactive profile creation
- `initialize_agent_sequence()`: Randomized agent ordering
- `get_concept_map_input()`: Mermaid.js concept map collection
- `conduct_scaffolding_round()`: Real-time scaffolding interaction
- `update_concept_map()`: Cumulative map building
- `save_session_data()`: Comprehensive data export

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Profile Creation → Agent Randomization → 
Round 1 (Agent A) → Concept Map Extension → 
Round 2 (Agent B) → Concept Map Extension → 
Round 3 (Agent C) → Concept Map Extension → 
Round 4 (Agent D) → Final Export
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running Experimental Sessions

```bash
python MAS/experimental_demo.py
```

### Required Setup

For experimental mode with OpenAI integration:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Session Flow

1. **Mode Selection**: Choose experimental or demo
2. **Profile Creation**: Answer guided questions
3. **Agent Randomization**: System generates unique sequence
4. **4 Interactive Rounds**: 
   - Concept map input (Mermaid.js syntax)
   - Agent scaffolding (OpenAI-powered)
   - User responses and reflection
   - Cumulative map building
5. **Data Export**: Automatic JSON + CSV export

## Data Export

### JSON Export
Complete session data including:
- Participant information
- Agent sequences and timings
- Full interaction transcripts
- Concept map evolution
- OpenAI usage statistics

### CSV Export
Flattened data for statistical analysis:
- Round-by-round metrics
- Agent performance data
- Concept map complexity measures
- Interaction patterns

## Experimental Validity Features

1. **Randomized Agent Sequences**: Eliminates order effects
2. **Non-Repeating Agents**: Each participant experiences all 4 scaffolding types
3. **Cumulative Concept Maps**: Realistic learning progression
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Complete data capture for analysis
5. **Standardized Interactions**: Consistent experimental conditions

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
- All imports verified with `test_imports.py`
- System initialization tested
- Agent creation and interaction flow validated
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms tested

### Error Handling
- OpenAI API failures gracefully handled with demo fallbacks
- Mermaid parsing errors captured and logged
- Session interruption handling with partial data save
- Comprehensive exception logging

## Research Applications
